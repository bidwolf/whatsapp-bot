# Command based Bot

This is an implementation that listen to messages in groups/private chats, the main idea is to develop an business logic that does not need to know the logic behind of the receive/send messages. In that way, all we need to do is configure providers like `whatsapp` or `discord` that will trigger commands in the Bot.
